# The Odin Project: Todo LIst

## About

A simple vanilla javascript todo list app made for the Odin Project web development course.

## Concepts/Tools Used

- The PubSub pattern
- SOLID programming principles
- Clean Code principles
- localStorage
- Webpack and NPM

## Points of improvement

- keeping logic and view seperate in a tidy manner
- Creating neat HTML with JavaScript, especially nesting divs for CSS purposes  

I'm interested to learn more about how technologies like React and Web Components allow me to approach these sorts of issues.
